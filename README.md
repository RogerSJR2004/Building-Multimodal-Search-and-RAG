# 📚 Building Multimodal Search and RAG

This repository is my personal journey into **multimodal search** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.
I’m learning the concepts by building practical code examples that combine **text, images, and embeddings** to explore how AI systems can **retrieve and reason** across different types of data.

---

## 🚀 What is this about?

* **Multimodal Search** → Search across different data types (text, images, documents, etc.) using vector embeddings.
* **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** → Improve AI responses by retrieving relevant external knowledge and feeding it into a language model.

The goal is to **experiment, learn, and document** how multimodal embeddings and RAG pipelines can be built from scratch and applied to real-world tasks.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python 3.10+**
* **LangChain** / **LlamaIndex** (for RAG pipelines)
* **SentenceTransformers / OpenAI Embeddings** (for text & image embeddings)
* **FAISS / ChromaDB** (for vector storage & retrieval)
* **Streamlit / FastAPI** (for building simple UIs & APIs)

---

## 🔥 Features (WIP)

* [x] Basic text embedding search
* [x] Document retrieval with FAISS
* [ ] Image-to-text retrieval
* [ ] Multimodal embeddings (text + image)
* [ ] RAG pipeline for Q\&A
* [ ] Simple web UI for search and chat

## 🧑‍💻 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RogerSJR2004/Building-Multimodal-Search-and-RAG.git
   cd multimodal-rag
   ```

2. **Create environment & install dependencies**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run a sample notebook**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/text_search.ipynb
   ```

4. **Try RAG pipeline (coming soon)**

   ```bash
   python src/rag_pipeline.py
   ```

## 🎯 Learning Goals

This repo is not just about code—it’s my **learning lab**.
I’m aiming to:

* Understand multimodal embeddings in depth.
* Learn how to design efficient vector search systems.
* Explore RAG for better AI reasoning.
* Build small apps to test concepts in real-world scenarios.

## 🤝 Contributing

I’m still learning, so suggestions, issues, and pull requests are welcome 🙌
Feel free to open a discussion or share ideas to make this repo more useful.

## 📌 Disclaimer

This project is a **learning journey**, not production-ready code.
Expect rough edges, lots of comments, and iterative improvements.

Would you like me to also make a **README badge-style version** (with shields like Python, LangChain, FAISS, etc.) so it looks more polished on GitHub?
